1. MEANING OF SIMPLE return;
ANS. 

You need to understand two things:

    1.The return statement - this does two things a) it terminates the method's execution returning the point of execution to the statement just after where the method was called, b) it provides a way of returning a value (if the method does return a value)
    1.A void method - the method does something but returns nothing

So a void method does not return anything so you just write return; to terminate. If say the method returned an int you would do something like return 5; or return myInt;.

2. strlen for character only and for string str.size()

3. How many distinct integers are factors of 90?

 A) 6
 B) 8 
 C) 9
 D) 10
 E) 12

 OA: E

Solution:

Approach 1: List down the factors. 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 9, 10, 15, 30, 45, 90 = 12
Approach 2: I just learnt about this method. So I thought I'd share it with you'll.

Prime factorization of 90 = 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^1
Now, we add 1 to each exponent and multiply them.
(1+1) * (2+1) * (1+1) = 12

It works with any number. I tried it. Let's take the example of 50. It's factors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 = 6
or 2^1 * 5^2 = (1+1) * (2+1) = 6

4. What is 1LL or 2LL in c/c++?
 ANS. 

	The LL makes the integer literal of type long long.

	So 2LL, is a 2 of type long long.

	Without the LL, the literal would only be of type int.

	This matters when you're doing stuff like this:

	1   << 40
	1LL << 40

	With just the literal 1, (assuming int to be 32-bits, you shift beyond the size of the integer 	type -> undefined behavior). With 1LL, you set the type to long long before hand and now it will properly return 2^40.

5. What is modulo 10^9+7
ANS. "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/modulo-1097-1000000007/"
      
 unsigned long long factorial(int n) 
 { 
    const unsigned int M = 1000000007; 
  
    unsigned long long f = 1; 
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) 
        f = (f*i) % M;  // Now f never can 
                        // exceed 10^9+7 
    return f; 
 }
